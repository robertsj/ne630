## Course Description 

From the catalog: Theory of neutron diffusion and thermalization with application to steady-state nuclear reactors.
 
## Textbook

E. E. Lewis, *Fundamentals of Nuclear Reactor Physics*, Academic Press, 2008.  

This book is available online through the library.  You may use [this link](https://k-state.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9942839834602401&context=L&vid=01KSU_INST:NewUI&search_scope=MyInstitution&tab=LibraryCatalog&lang=en) to access it (credentials required).
 
## Prerequisites

NE 495 and MATH 240.  Generally, we also prefer students take NE 690 before NE 630: if you didn't, that's okay, but let me know.

## Lectures 



## Grading

Grading for the course is based on the following breakdown:

- 15 homeworks (roughly 1 per week)
- 3 exams (including final)


## Course Calendar

The following is a preliminary schedule of lectures and associated reading. 

**TO BE COMPLETED AFTER FIRST LECTURE** (but roughly 1 chapter every 1-2 weeks)

## Academic Honesty

Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one's work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the Honor and Integrity System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: "On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work." A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.

## Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their instructor.  Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety. If you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center at accesscenter@k-state.edu, 785-532-6441; for K-State Polytechnic campus, contact Julie Rowe, Diversity, Inclusion and Access Coordinator, at jarowe@ksu.edu or call 785-826-2971.

## Expectations for Classroom Conduct

All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class.
