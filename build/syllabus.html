<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>NE 495 and MATH 240. Generally, we also prefer students take NE 690
before NE 630: if you didn’t, that’s okay, but let me know.</p>
<h2 id="lectures">Lectures</h2>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Grading for the course is based on the following breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>15 homeworks (roughly 1 per week)</li>
<li>3 exams (including final)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-calendar">Course Calendar</h2>
<p>The following is a preliminary schedule of lectures and associated
reading.</p>
<p><strong>TO BE COMPLETED AFTER FIRST LECTURE</strong> (but roughly 1
chapter every 1-2 weeks)</p>
<h2 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on
personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that,
in academic matters, one’s work is performed honestly and without
unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by
registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity
System. The policies and procedures of the Honor and Integrity System
apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and
graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A
component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of
the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or
other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied,
whether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a student, I have neither
given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.” A grade of
XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure
in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge
violation.</p>
<h2 id="students-with-disabilities">Students with Disabilities</h2>
<p>Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access
to technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation
processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their
instructor. Services are available to students with a wide range of
disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities,
medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder,
depression, and anxiety. If you are a student enrolled in campus/online
courses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student
Access Center at accesscenter@k-state.edu, 785-532-6441; for K-State
Polytechnic campus, contact Julie Rowe, Diversity, Inclusion and Access
Coordinator, at jarowe@ksu.edu or call 785-826-2971.</p>
<h2 id="expectations-for-classroom-conduct">Expectations for Classroom
Conduct</h2>
<p>All student activities in the University, including this course, are
governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student
Governing Association By Laws, Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students
who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be
asked to leave the class.</p>
