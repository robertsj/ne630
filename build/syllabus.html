<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>From the catalog: Theory of neutron diffusion and thermalization with application to steady-state nuclear reactors. For a brief introduction to this course, head to Course Introduction under the Administriva module.</p>
<h2 id="textbook">Textbook</h2>
<p>E. E. Lewis, <em>Fundamentals of Nuclear Reactor Physics</em>, Academic Press, 2008.</p>
<p>This book is available online through the library. You may use <a href="https://k-state.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9942839834602401&amp;context=L&amp;vid=01KSU_INST:NewUI&amp;search_scope=MyInstitution&amp;tab=LibraryCatalog&amp;lang=en">this link</a> to access it (credentials required).</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>NE 495 and MATH 240. Though not required, having had ME 400 or some other programming experience should be useful in this course.</p>
<h2 id="lectures">Lectures</h2>
<p>Lectures, I hope, will be informal yet provide useful interpretation of the readings and demonstration of the associated problem-solving techniques. In other words, verbal Cliff’s notes and worked examples. However, I’m only one of the 20+ of us, so y’all need to participate to make the time most valuable. That means doing the reading (including this syllabus; the reading for our first lecture is Sections 1.1–1.3 of the textbook.)</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Grading for the course is based on the following breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>homeworks (approximately 12, together worth 40%)</li>
<li>exams (3, each worth 20%)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mandatory-statements">Mandatory Statements</h2>
<h3 id="statement-regarding-academic-honesty">Statement Regarding Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the Honor and Integrity System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.” A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.</p>

<p>At K-State, faculty and staff are committed to creating and maintaining an inclusive and supportive learning environment for students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

<p>Faculty and staff are committed to promoting equity and believe the success of an inclusive learning environment relies on the participation, support, and understanding of all students. Students are encouraged to share their views and lived experiences as they relate to the course or their course experience, while recognizing they are doing so in a learning environment in which all are expected to engage with respect to honor the rights, safety, and dignity of others in keeping with the K-State Principles of Community.</p>
