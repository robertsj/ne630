<p>Welcome to NE 630 - Nuclear Reactor Theory! What is “nuclear reactor
theory?” Good question. Nuclear reactor theory is all about the physics
of systems that use neutrons to produce fissions in a self-sustaining,
chain reaction. Often, this discipline is called <strong>reactor
physics</strong>, a term I’ll use often.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, reactor physics combines all the basics from NE 495
(reactions, cross sections, fluxes) to produce a mathematical model that
describes the neutron population in a reactor. For us, that model will
be the <em>neutron diffusion equation</em> that describes the neutron
density in space, energy, and time:</p>

<p>Whoa! That’s a bit overwhelming, no? Don’t worry! While some of the
symbols may look familiar (e.g., <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is the neutron flux and <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_t\)</span> is the total, macroscopic cross
section), some of them are likely new to you.</p>
<p>The same goes for the math involved: as written, the equation is an
integro-differential equation, which means there are both derivatives
and integrals of the unknown flux. Again, don’t worry! A big part of
learning and using reactor physics is to reduce the governing equations
to the simplest possible form that captures the physics of interest. An
example I always include in NE 495 is the four-factor formula (<span
class="math inline">\(k_{\text{eff}} = f p \eta \epsilon)\)</span>),
which one can derive from the diffusion equation by ignoring space and
time and by separating neutron energies into “thermal” and “fast.” If
that looks Greek to you, don’t worry: we’ll be doing that derivation
later in class!</p>
<p>During the course, we’ll follow the textbook pretty closely and cover
the majority of its content. A detailed lesson schedule will be provided
elsewhere, but the coarse-grained structure is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nuclear reactions, radioactive decay, and neutron interactions [2-3
weeks]</li>
<li>Neutron energy distributions, and energy-integrated, steady-state
reaction rates, and the multigroup method (no space, no time) [2-3
weeks]</li>
<li>Reactor kinetics, dynamics, and depletion (i.e., time-dependent
reaction rates) (no space, no energy) [4-5 weeks]</li>
<li>Neutron spatial distributions for source-driven and critical systems
(no time, either no energy or multigroup) [4-5 weeks]</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I believe it’s important for students to be able to use
computers both to solve problems and to perform “experiments” (i.e.,
simulations) that reinforce all the “theory.” For solving problems, I
will often use Jupyter, a browser-based tool that lets one combine code
and words in an online “notebook.” For experiements, we’ll use the free
and open-source Monte Carlo code OpenMC, which will be available on a
remote cluster (e.g., Beocat). How much we use either tool for in-class
activities and homework assignments will depend on your previous
experience and interests.</p>
