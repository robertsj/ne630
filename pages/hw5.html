<h1 id="homework-for-week-5">Homework for Week 5</h1>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Homework is typically due at 1:30pm on Friday.
However, because some of this material is relevant for the exam, I am
having this due Thursday at 11:59 pm. But, I’ve converted the two more
time-consuming problems into extra credit worth 4 points each. These can
be turned in with the next homework.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(EXTRA CREDIT) In the last homework, you computed a spectrum
<img 
class="equation_image" 
title="\phi(E)" 
src="/equation_images/%255Cphi(E)" 
alt="LaTeX: \phi(E)" 
data-equation-content="\phi(E)" 
/> representative of a
thermal-spectrum reactor. As we learned (see solution), the
approximations we’ve used make it hard to define a spectrum that is
“realistic” between the primary energy ranges. I proposed an improved
spectrum that I’ve tabulated for you (first column is <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, second is the spectrum to use; the
third column applies the NR approximation).<br />
Use this spectrum produce <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{\sigma_s}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{\sigma_{\gamma}}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{\sigma_f}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{\nu\sigma_f}\)</span> for H-1, O-16, U-235,
and U-238.</p></li>
<li><p>(EXTRA CREDIT) For a 50-50 mixture (by volume) of UO<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> (10 g/cm<span
class="math inline">\(^3\)</span>) and H<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O (1 g/cm<span
class="math inline">\(^3\)</span>), compute <span
class="math inline">\(k_{\infty}\)</span> (using the cross sections you
just computed).</p></li>
<li><p>The spectrum you just used had <span
class="math inline">\(1/E\)</span> dependence through the resonance
range. How do you think <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="k_{\infty}" 
src="/equation_images/k_%257B%255Cinfty%257D"

/>
would change if the NR approximation were used in place of <span
class="math inline">\(1/E\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>Representative two-group cross sections for a pressurized-water
reactor are given in the table below.<br />
Use these data to compute <span
class="math inline">\(k_{\infty}\)</span> and the ratio <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_1/\phi_2\)</span>. Note that the
<em>removal</em> cross section <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_{rg}\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_{tg} - \Sigma_{sg\gets g&#39;}\)</span> and
that <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_{tg} = \Sigma_{ag} +
\sum_{g&#39;} \Sigma_{sg&#39;\gets g}\)</span>.</p></li>
