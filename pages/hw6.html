<h1 id="homework-for-week-6">Homework for Week 6</h1>
<p>I’m changing things up a bit based on how Examn 1 went. I will now
include the M and W parts of the content covered that week (e.g., if we
cover it on a M or W, it can be due on F). Homeworks will now be due on
Friday’s but at 5 pm. This will help reduce the time between seeing the
content and doing the content for many of you.</p>
<p>So, your problems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.1</li>
<li>4.3</li>
<li>4.4</li>
<li>4.6</li>
<li>4.8</li>
<li>4.9</li>
<li>In-class exercise from Lesson 18 (on OpenMC)</li>
</ul>
