# Homework for Week 6

I'm changing things up a bit based on how Examn 1 went. I will now include the M and W parts of the content covered that week (e.g., if we cover it on a M or W, it can be due on F). Homeworks will now be due on Friday's but at 5 pm.  This will help reduce the time between seeing the content and doing the content for many of you.

So, your problems are:

 - 4.1
 - 4.3
 - 4.4
 - 4.6
 - 4.8
 - 4.9
 - In-class exercise from Lesson 18 (on OpenMC)
