<p>Almost everyone got to the right set of equations from the boundary
conditions but a few folks didn’t get that <span
class="math inline">\(C_1=C_2=0\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="homework-33">Homework 33</h1>
<p>For 33.1, most folks did well. Some botched the boundary conditions.
Write these out by hand! SymPy is good for double checking (and for nice
looking math), but you need to be able to set these up on paper. When
plotting multiple-region fluxes, be sure not to plot the flux for one
region over x values that belong to another region!</p>
<p>For 33.2, a few folks were concerned by the “messy” results. Recall
that, for a single-region slab, we will always have a system like <span
class="math inline">\(aC_1 + bC_2 = s_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(cC_1 + dC_2 = s_2\)</span> from the boundary
conditions. Yes, the <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="a, b, c, d" 
src="/equation_images/a%252C%2520b%252C%2520c%252C%2520d" 
alt="LaTeX: a, b, c, d" 
data-equation-content="a, b, c, d" 
/> and
maybe <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="s_1" 
src="/equation_images/s_1" 
alt="LaTeX: s_1" 
data-equation-content="s_1" 
/> and <span
class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> depend on <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_a\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, but we don’t have to write all that
out! So, as long as you can get to, e.g., <span
class="math inline">\(C_1 = (d s_2 -b s_2)/(a d - bc)\)</span>, then you
can can do integration, differention, numerical substitution, etc., all
using the basic form <span class="math inline">\(\phi(x) = C_1 e^{x/L} +
C_2 e^{-a/L} + \phi_p(x)\)</span>. In other words, you can evaluate
<span class="math inline">\(J_{\mp}(x) = \phi(x)/4 \pm
(D/2)d\phi/dx\)</span>.</p>
<p>A handful of folks used <span class="math inline">\(\alpha =
(1-2D/L)/(1+2D/L)\)</span> as defined by Eq. (6.41) in the text for
<img 
class="equation_image" 
title="R" 
src="/equation_images/R" 
alt="LaTeX: R" 
data-equation-content="R" 
/>. Recall, though, Eq. (6.40) is
for an <em>infinite</em> half space (Eq. 6.40 is the general definition
for the albedo which is equivalent to the reflection coefficient). For
our problem, we’d get <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="R \to \alpha" 
src="/equation_images/R%2520%255Cto%2520%255Calpha" 
alt="LaTeX: R \to \alpha" 
data-equation-content="R \to \alpha" 
/>
in the limit that <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="a \to \infty" 
src="/equation_images/a%2520%255Cto%2520%255Cinfty" 
alt="LaTeX: a \to \infty" 
data-equation-content="a \to \infty" 
/>.</p>
