<h2 id="before-lecture">Before Lecture</h2>
<p>Read sections 1.1–1.3 in the book.</p>
<p>While reading, define the key terms in your notes and consider the
learning objectives.</p>
<h2 id="after-lecture">After Lecture</h2>
<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<p>Do problems 1.2, 1.5, and 1.6. For 1.6, are the numbers in the
problem statement consistent with the 20 tons of nuclear fuel per year
and the 10,000 tons of coal per day for a roughly 3000 MW power plant?
State your assumptions!</p>
<p>Note, these problems form part of the week 1 homework. You can solve
them and upload them to Canvas alone or combine all problems. Typically,
I’ll have the assignment due on the Friday following the week in which
the content is covered (e.g., the first homework will be due Friday on
our second week). Because the problem value and number of problems will
vary, assignment values may vary (though I’ll aim for uniformity!).</p>
<p><strong>Enrichment</strong>: Check out this <a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07427.pdf">article</a> about nuclear
batteries, another example of nuclear power. How do the energy density
and power density of nuclear and coal power line up on Figure 2 of the
paper (which shows the energy density of various batteries against their
power densities in a format known as a <em>Ragone plot</em>.)</p>
