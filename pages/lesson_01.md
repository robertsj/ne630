# Lesson 1

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

### Macro Objectives

 - Determine and quantify the reactants, products, and energy inputs/outputs of nuclear reactions.

### Micro Objectives

 - Compare the energy densities of different reaction types.
 - Compute the total energy of a particle of (rest) mass $m_0$ with a speed $v$.
 - Explain the nomenclature ${}^A_Z X$.
 - Provide an example of a binary nuclear reaction of the form $A(B,C)D$.
 - Compute the Q value for $A(B,C)D$.
 - Provide an example of radioactive decay of the form $A \to B + C$.
 - Demonstrate that the kinematics of neutrons with energies below about 10 MeV can be well approximated classically.
 - Compute the mass defect of ${}^A_Z X$.
 - Compute the binding energy per nucleon of ${}^A_Z X$.
 - Explain how Q values relate to decay.

## Before Lecture

Read sections 1.1--1.3 in the book.

While reading, define the key terms in your notes and consider the learning objectives.

## After Lecture

### Homework

Do problems 1.2, 1.5, and 1.6.  For 1.6, are the numbers in the problem statement consistent with the 20 tons of nuclear fuel per year and the 10,000 tons of coal per day for a roughly 3000 MW power plant?  State your assumptions!

Note, these problems form part of the week 1 homework.  You can solve them and upload them to Canvas alone or combine all problems.  Typically, I'll have the assignment due on the Friday following the week in which the content is covered (e.g., the first homework will be due Friday on our second week).  Because the problem value and number of problems will vary, assignment values may vary (though I'll aim for uniformity!).

**Enrichment**: Check out this [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07427.pdf) about nuclear batteries, another example of nuclear power.  How do the energy density and power density of nuclear and coal power line up on Figure 2 of the paper (which shows the energy density of various batteries against their power densities in a format known as a *Ragone plot*.)
