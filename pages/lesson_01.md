# Lesson 1

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

### Macro Objectives

 - Determine and quantify the reactants, products, and energy inputs/outputs of nuclear reactions.

### Micro Objectives

 - Compare the energy densities of different reaction types.
 - Compute the total energy of a particle of (rest) mass $m_0$ with a speed $v$.
 - Explain the nomenclature ${}^A_Z X$.
 - Provide an example of a binary nuclear reaction of the form $A(B,C)D$.
 - Compute the Q value for $A(B,C)D$.
 - Provide an example of radioactive decay of the form $A \to B + C$.
 - Demonstrate that the kinematics of neutrons with energies below about 10 MeV can be well approximated classically.
 - Compute the mass defect of ${}^A_Z X$.
 - Compute the binding energy per nucleon of ${}^A_Z X$.
 - Explain how Q values relate to decay.

## Before Lecture

Read sections 1.1--1.3 in the book.

While reading, define the key terms in your notes and consider the learning objectives.

## After Lecture

### Homework

See Canvas for the problem statements.

### Enrichment

Check out this [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07427.pdf) about nuclear batteries, another example of nuclear power.  How do the energy density and power density of nuclear and coal power line up on Figure 2 of the paper (which shows the energy density of various batteries against their power densities in a format known as a *Ragone plot*.)
