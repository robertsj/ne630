# Lesson 2

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

### Macro Objectives

 - Characterize the neutron population and energy produced as a function of time in terms of the neutron lifetime, the energy released from fission, and the multiplication factor $k$.

### Micro Objectives

 - Provide an example fission reaction and compute its Q value.
 - List three forms of "nuclear" power.
 - List the type and fraction o particles emitted from fission.
 - Construct a mathematical model for the multiplication of neutrons.
 - Explain criticality, subcriticality, and supercriticality.
 - Estimate the heat generation rate of spent nuclear fuel.
 - Compare fissile and fertile materials.
 - List the major fissile and fertile nuclides.
 - Explain why fission products are neutron rich.
 - Describe the trend of stable nuclei as functions of $Z$ and $A$.

## Key Terms

 - multiplication

## Before Lecture

Read sections 1.4--1.5 in the book.

## After Lecture

### Homework

 - Problem 1.9 from the book.
 - Lewis references about 40 fission fragment pairs that emerge 
   from fission.  For fission of U-235, find three of these 
   pairs, write the reaction, and compute Q value.
