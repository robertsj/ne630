# Lesson 3

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

### Macro Objectives

 - Determine the amounts of a radioactive species and its daughters at any point in time given initial amounts.

### Micro Objectives

 - Convert $t_{1/2}$ to $\bar{t}$ and $\lambda$.
 - Solve $N' = -\lambda N(t)$, $N(0)$ given.
 - Solve $N' = -\lambda N(t) + R(t)$, $N(0)$ and $R(t)$ given.
 - Convert between Ci, Bq, kg, and number (or moles).
 - Describe *saturation activity* and how long it takes to achieve.
 - Solve the system $N_i' = -\lambda_i N_i(t) + \lambda_{i-1} N_{i-1} + R_i(t)$ for $i = 0, 1, \ldots$, with $N_i(0)$ and $R_i(t)$ given, $\lambda_{-1} = 0$.
 - Describe secular equilibrium.
