# Lesson 4

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

### Macro Objectives

 - Characterize the attenuation of neutrons in a parallel beam or emitted from a point source as a function of distance and material composition.

### Micro Objectives

 - Describe the motion (or "transport") of neutrons through space.
 - Illustrate how the microscopic cross sections of individual nuclei manifest at the macroscopic scale through attenuation.
 - Explain the difference between material and geometric attenuation.
 - Compute the number density of any nuclide in a chemical composition.
 - Define the nuclide composition of uranium mixtures given enrichment.

## Key Terms

 - cross section (short for nuclear cross-sectional area)
 - neutron density $n$ [n/cm$^3$] (or, as in the book, $n'''$, where the triple prime is often used in engineering for volumetric quantities such as heat generation rate $q'''$ [W/cm$^3$])
 - beam intensity $I(x)$ [n/cm$^2$-s]
 - microscopic cross section $\sigma$ [cm$^2$] or [b] ("barn")
 - macroscopic cross section $\Sigma$ [cm$^{-1}$] (the synonymous *linear attenuation coefficient* $\mu$ is often used in radiation shielding, but we'll always use $\Sigma$)
 - survival fraction ($e^{-\Sigma x}$)
 - first-collision probability ($\Sigma e^{-\Sigma x}$)
 - mean free path
 - uncollided flux ($\phi_u$)
 - point source 
 - material attenuation
 - geometric attenuation
 - atom (or number) density 
 - Avogadro's number
 - atomic (or molecular) mass; historically, "weight" is often used instead of "mass."
 - enrichment
 - weight percent (w/o) (another historical mis-use of "weight" when "mass" is meant)
 - atom percent (a/o)
