# Lesson 5

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

### Macro Objectives

 - For a neutron of energy $E$, determine the interactions it can undergo and compute
   the probability that it undergoes a particular reaction.

### Micro Objectives

 - Find $\sigma_x(E)$ (i.e., the microscopic cross section for a reaction $x$) from an appropriate tabulation
 - Explain how the kinetic energies of an incident neutron and the target nucleus impact $\sigma_x(E)$
 - Plot tabulated cross sections over appropriate energy ranges
 - For a given neutron energy $E$ and nuclide composition, determine the microscopic cross section for each nuclide and reaction.
 - For a given neutron energy $E$ and nuclide composition, determine the macroscopic cross section for each reaction.
