# Lesson 5

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

### Macro Objectives

 - For a neutron of energy $E$, predict the likely interactions it can undergo and compute
   the probability that it undergoes a particular reaction.

### Micro Objectives

 - Find $\sigma_x(E)$ (i.e., the microscopic cross section for a reaction $x$) from an appropriate tabulation
 - Approximate $\sigma_x(E)$ directly from resonance data
 - Explain how the kinetic energies of an incident neutron and the target nucleus impact $\sigma_x(E)$
 - Provide examples of threshold reactions
 - Specify the range of energies over which neutron interactions occur in nuclear reactors
 - Plot tabulated cross sections over appropriate energy ranges
 -

### Homework

 - Problem 2.9 from the book.
 - Acquire and plot $\sigma_{\gamma}$ for ${}^{238}$U and $10^{-4} < E  < 100$ eV.
 - The Breit-Wigner (BW) formula of Eq. (2.41) defines $\sigma_{\gamma}(E)$ given a single
   resonance at energy $E_0$.  For multiple resonances centered at $E_0^i$, $i = 1, 2, \ldots$,
   the cross section is the sum of the individual BW cross sections.  
   Data for the first 6 resonances of ${}^{238}$ U are provided in the table below.
   Using this data and the expressions $\sigma_0 = 4\pi \lambda_0^2 \Gamma_n/\Gamma$ and
   $\lambda_0 = 4.55\times 10^{-10} / \sqrt{E}$, reconstruct and plot $\sigma_{\gamma}(E)$ 
   over $10^{-5} < E  < 100$ eV.
 - Consider UO$_2$ (4 w/o enrichment, 10 g/cm$^3$).  For neutrons of 
    0.0253 eV, 1 keV, and 1 MeV, determine the probability that it
    - induces fission
    - induces fission of a U-238 nucleus
    - elastically scatters
    - elastically scatters off an O-16 nucleus
