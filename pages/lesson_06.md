# Lesson 6

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

### Macro Objectives


 - Describe the range of neutron energies typical of nuclear reactors and the likely interactions neutrons undergo throughout that range.

### Micro Objectives

 - Approximate $\sigma_x(E)$ directly from resonance data
 - Specify the range of energies over which neutron interactions occur in nuclear reactors
 - Provide examples of threshold reactions
 - List the properties of a probability density function.
 - Provide examples of common distributions.
 - Compute the expected value $E[f(x)]$ for $x \sim p(x)$.

## Before Lecture

Nothing extra; we'll look at Sections 2.3 and 2.4 in more detail along with a deeper dive into the available cross-section data.
