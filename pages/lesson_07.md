# Lesson 7

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

### Macro Objectives

 - Estimate the number of elastic collisions a neutron of energy $E$ must make with a nucleus of mass number $A$ to slow to an energy $E'$.

### Micro Objectives

 - For a given target nuclide, predict whether elastic or inelastic scattering dominates the slowing of neutrons.
 - Compute the minimum, maximum, and expected outgoing energy of a neutron of energy $E$ after it scatters elastically (and isotropically) off of a given target nucleus.
 - Compute the probability that a neutron of energy $E$ loses a given fraction of its energy following an elastic collision.
 - Derive the slowing down decrement $\xi$ for a material with multiple nuclides.

## Key Terms

 - slowing down decrement
 - elastic scattering
 - inelastic scattering
 - isotropic
 - center of mass (system)
 - laboratory (system)

## Before Lecture

  - Read section 2.5 in the textbook.  
  - Read sections 2.1-2.2 from Rydin, *Nuclear Reactor Theory and Design*; see the link in Modules.  The other sections relate to what we've already covered and may be useful for review (but are not required reading).


## After Lecture

### Homework

 - Problems 2.14 and 2.18 from the book.
