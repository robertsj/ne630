<p>Students will be able to…</p>
<h3 id="macro-objectives">Macro Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explain in a “big picture” sense what the goals of thermal and fast
reactor designs are and how they differ based on <span
class="math inline">\(\eta(E)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_s\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_a\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="micro-objectives">Micro Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Compute the slowing down decrement, power, and ratio of a
moderator.</li>
<li>Explain what features make a moderator a “good” one.</li>
<li>Compute, visualize, and characterize the ratio <span
class="math inline">\(\eta(E)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Compute <img

title="\Sigma_a" 
src="/equation_images/%255CSigma_a" 
alt="LaTeX: \Sigma_a" 
data-equation-content="\Sigma_a" 
/>.</li>
<li>List the assumptions and simplifications required to analyze a
steady-state, infinite, homogeneous reactor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-terms">Key Terms</h2>
<ul>
<li>moderator/moderations</li>
<li><img 
class="equation_image" 
title="\eta(E)" 
src="/equation_images/%255Ceta(E)" 
alt="LaTeX: \eta(E)" 
data-equation-content="\eta(E)" 
/>, which, when averaged
over energy, is sometimes called the “reproduction factor”</li>
<li>low-enriched (LEU), high-enriched (HEU), and weapons-grade nuclear
uranium</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="before-lecture">Before Lecture</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read sections 3.1–3.3 in the textbook.<br />
</li>
<li>The notion of “weapons-grade” fuel is introduced in that reading; do
a bit of sleuthing, and come to class with definitions for LEU and
HEU.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="after-lecture">After Lecture</h2>
<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reproduce Figure 3.2, and add a curve for U enriched to 4%.</li>
<li>For the 4% values, compute the expected value of <span
class="math inline">\(\eta(E)\)</span> assuming that (a) <span
class="math inline">\(p(E)\)</span> is uniform and (b) <span
class="math inline">\(p(E) = C/E\)</span> for energies <span
class="math inline">\(10^{-3} &lt; E &lt; 10^{7}\)</span> eV. (Note: you
need to define <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="C" 
src="/equation_images/C" 
alt="LaTeX: C" 
data-equation-content="C" 
/> using the
properties of probability density functions).</li>
