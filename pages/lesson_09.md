title: The fast and epithermal spectra of infinite, homogeneous systems without absorption.

# Lesson 9

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives

Students will be able to approximate the flux spectra $\phi(E)$ of fast neutrons and epithermal neutrons subject to elastic collisions in the absence of resonance absorption in infinite, homogeneous systems.

### Micro Objectives

 1. *Recall* $\Sigma_x$, $\chi(E)$, $p(E'\to E)$, $\xi$, $\alpha$, $1$ eV and $0.1$ MeV as "cutoffs"
 2. Explain the differences and relationships between the neutron density distribution $\tilde{n}'''(E)$, the neutron density $n'''$, and the neutron flux distribution $\phi(E)$ (the book uses $\varphi(E)$, but I'll stick with $\phi(E)$ because that's how I write it by hand.)
 3. Explain the neutron flux in terms of neutron path lengths.
 4. Describe mathematically the volumetric rate $R_x$ [1/cm$^3$-s] of some reaction $x$.
 5. Write down and explain the terms of the neutron slowing-down equation (SDE).
 6. Explain the difference between the collision rate $R_s(E)=\Sigma_S(E)\phi(E)$ and the slowing-down density $q(E)$.
 7. Verify that the solution to the SDE for purely-scattering media satisfies $\Sigma_S\phi(E) \propto E^{-1}$.

 - slowing down density


## Before Lecture

  - Read section 3.4 of the book, focusing on the material up to Energy Self-Shielding on page 68.
  - Go back a few lectures to my numerical experiment with neutrons born at 1 MeV.  Consider
    how a small tweak might be made to estimate $q(E)$ for energies $E = [10^{-3}, 10^{-2}, \ldots, 10^5]$ eV.
