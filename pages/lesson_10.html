<h3 id="macro-objectives">Macro Objectives</h3>
<p>Students will be able to approximate the flux spectra <span
class="math inline">\(\phi(E)\)</span> of epithermal neutrons subject to
elastic collisions and resonance absorption in infinite, homogeneous
systems.</p>
<h3 id="micro-objectives">Micro Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write down the slowing-down equation for a system with a moderator
and fuel.</li>
<li>Explain what a “narrow” resonance is in terms of the width <span

class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of the resonant nucleus.</li>
<li>Use the narrow resonance (NR) approximation to define an
intermediate flux spectrum.</li>
<li>Describe the impact of a resonance located at <span
class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> on the neutron flux spectrum near
that energy.</li>
<li>Estimate the fraction of neutrons that pass by one or more
resonances.</li>
