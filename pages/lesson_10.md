# Lesson 10

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

### Macro Objectives

Students will be able to approximate the flux spectra $\phi(E)$ of epithermal neutrons subject to elastic collisions and resonance absorption in infinite, homogeneous systems.

### Micro Objectives

 - Write down the slowing-down equation for a system with a moderator and fuel.
 - Explain what a "narrow" resonance is in terms of the width $\Gamma$ and the mass number $A$ of the resonant nucleus.
 - Use the narrow resonance (NR) approximation to define an intermediate flux spectrum.
 - Describe the impact of a resonance located at $E_r$ on the neutron flux spectrum near that energy.
 - Estimate the fraction of neutrons that pass by one or more resonances.

## Key Terms

 - resonance absorption
 - narrow/wide resonance
 - narrow-resonance approximation
 - narrow-resonance spectrum $\phi(E) \propto \frac{1}{\Sigma_t(E)E)}$
 - resonance-escape probability

## Before Lecture

  - Read section 3.4, focusing on "energy self-shielding."
  - Skim as desired the supplementary notes.

## After Lecture

### Homework

 - 3.6
 - Use the NR approximation to approximate the flux spectrum for 
   a 1000-to-1 mixture of ${}^1$H-to-${}^{238}$U (by atom) and plot it over $1 < E < 100$ eV.   
   Repeat for 100-to-1, and 10-to-1 mixtures.  How does the ratio of moderator to fuel 
   impact the energy self-shielding effect?
