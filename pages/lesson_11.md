# Lesson 11

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to approximate the flux distribution of thermal neutrons in a thermal-spectrum reactor.

### Macro Objectives

 - Explain in a "big picture" sense what the goals of thermal and fast reactor designs are and how they differ based on $\eta(E)$, $\xi$, $\Sigma_s$ and $\Sigma_a$.

### Micro Objectives

 - Compute the slowing down decrement, power, and ratio of a moderator.
 - Explain what features make a moderator a "good" one.
 - Compute, visualize, and characterize the ratio $\eta(E)$.
 - Compute $\Sigma_a$.
 - List the assumptions and simplifications required to analyze a steady-state, infinite, homogeneous reactor.

## Key Terms

 - moderator/moderations
 - $\eta(E)$, which, when averaged over energy, is sometimes called the "reproduction factor"
 - low-enriched (LEU), high-enriched (HEU), and weapons-grade nuclear uranium

## Before Lecture

  - Read sections 3.1--3.3 in the textbook.  
  - The notion of "weapons-grade" fuel is introduced in that reading; do a bit of sleuthing, and come to class with definitions for LEU and HEU.


## After Lecture

### Homework

 - Reproduce Figure 3.2, and add a curve for U enriched to 4%.
 - Consider a 1-to-1 mixture of ${}^{238}$U and ${}^{1}$H.  Compute and plot the NR flux spectrum for $1 < E  < 10^{5}$ eV.  Clearly state any assumptions or approximations you make.
