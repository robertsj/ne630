# Lesson 11

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to approximate the flux distribution of thermal neutrons in a thermal-spectrum reactor.

### Macro Objectives

Students will be able to approximate the flux distribution of thermal neutrons in a thermal-spectrum reactor.


### Micro Objectives

 - Write down the balance equation for thermal neutrons of energy below $E_{th} = 1$ eV.
 - Explain the idea of detailed balance.
 - State the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, i.e., $\phi_{MB}(E) \propto E e^{-E/kT}$.
 - Describe the impact of absorption and temperature on the thermal spectrum.
 - Describe why the free-gas approximation may be unsuitable for real materials.

## Key Terms

 - (principle of) detailed balance
 - upscatter
 - thermal equilibrium
 - free-gas approximation
 - spectral hardening
