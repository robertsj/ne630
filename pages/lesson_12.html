<ul>
<li><p>Use the spectrum you constructed in Homework 3 to produce <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{\sigma_s}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{\sigma_{\gamma}}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{\sigma_f}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{\nu\sigma_f}\)</span> for H-1, O-16, U-235,
and U-238.</p></li>
<li><p>For a 50-50 mixture (by volume) of UO<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> (10 g/cm<span
class="math inline">\(^3\)</span>) and H<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O (1 g/cm<span
class="math inline">\(^3\)</span>), compute <span
class="math inline">\(k_{\infty}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The spectrum you just used had <span
class="math inline">\(1/E\)</span> dependence through the resonance
range. How do you think <img

would change if the NR approximation were used in place of <span
class="math inline">\(1/E\)</span>?</p></li>
