# Lesson 12

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives


Students will be able to compute effective cross sections and reaction rates 
averaged over the entire energy range of interest in order to estimate the multiplication 
factor of an infinite, homogeneous system.


### Micro Objectives

 - Write down a mathematical expression for an effective cross section.
 - Use integration to convert the spectrum (slowing-down) equation into
   an algebraic expression of single, integrated reaction rates.
 - Express the infinite-medium multiplication factor in terms of effective
   cross sections.
 - Numerically compute an effective cross section over any desired energy interval from tabulated data.

## Key Terms

 - multiplication factor
 - effective/energy-averaged cross section

### Homework

 - Use the spectrum you constructed in Homework 3 to produce $\bar{\sigma_s}$, $\bar{\sigma_{\gamma}}$, 
   and $\bar{\sigma_f}$, and $\bar{\nu\sigma_f}$ for H-1, O-16, U-235, and U-238. 

 - For a 50-50 mixture (by volume) of UO$_2$ (10 g/cm$^3$) and H$_2$O (1 g/cm$^3$), compute $k_{\infty}$.

 - The spectrum you just used had $1/E$ dependence through the resonance range.  How do you think $k_{\infty}$ 
   would change if the NR approximation were used in place of $1/E$?
