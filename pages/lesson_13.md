# Lesson 13

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives


Students will be able to express the multiplication factor, thermal flux, and fast flux 
in the two-group formalism for an infinite, homogeneous system.


### Micro Objectives

 - Describe the relationship between a *resonance integral* and *effective cross section*.
 - Compute two-group cross sections from tabulated data using appropriate spectra.
 - 

## Key Terms

 - energy group
 - multigroup approximation
 

## Before Lecture

  - Read sections 3.5 and 3.6.
  - Supplement

## After Lecture

### Homework

 - Representative two-group cross sections for a pressurized-water reactor are given in the table below.  
   Use these data to compute $k_{\infty}$ and the ratio $\phi_1/\phi_2$.  Note that the *removal* cross 
   section $\Sigma_{rg}$ is $\Sigma_{tg} - \Sigma_{sg\gets g'}$ and that $\Sigma_{tg} = \Sigma_{ag} + \sum_{g'} \Sigma_{sg'\gets g}$.

|                         |   $g = 1$ | $g = 2$ |
|-------------------------|-----------|---------|
|	$\bar{\nu}\Sigma_{fg}$  | 0.008476	|	0.18514 |
|	$\Sigma_{fg}$           | 0.003320	| 0.07537 |
| $\Sigma_{ag}$         	| 0.01207	  | 0.1210 |
|	$\Sigma_{rg}$           | 0.02619   | 0.1210 |
