# Lesson 13

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives


Students will be able to express the multiplication factor, thermal flux, and fast flux 
in the two-group formalism for an infinite, homogeneous system.


### Micro Objectives

 - Describe the relationship between a *resonance integral* and *effective cross section*.
 - Compute two-group cross sections from tabulated data using appropriate spectra.
 - Express the balance of neutrons in a source-driven, infinite, homogeneous medium in terms of two-group fluxes and data.
 - Express the balance of neutrons in a multiplication-driven, infinite, homogeneous medium in terms of two-group fluxes and data.
 - Use OpenMC to produce multi-group cross sections from an infinite-homogeneous model.
