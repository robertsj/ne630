# Lesson 14

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives


Students will be able to express the multiplication factor, thermal flux, and fast flux 
in the multi-group formalism for an infinite, homogeneous system.


### Micro Objectives

 - Describe the spectrum equation as linear system of equations (i.e., $\mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{b}$)
 - Describe the spectrum equation as an eigenvalue problem (i.e., $\mathbf{Ax}=\lambda\mathbf{x}$)
 - Plot multigroup functions (e.g., cross sections and fluxes) as functions of energy and lethargy.

## Key Terms

 - linear system
 - eigensystem, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors
 

## Before Lecture

  - Supplement on the Multigroup Approximation

## After Lecture

### Homework

 - See Canvas for problem statement.
