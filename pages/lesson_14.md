# Lesson 14

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives


Students will be able to express the multiplication factor, thermal flux, and fast flux 
in the multi-group formalism for an infinite, homogeneous system.


### Micro Objectives

 - Describe the spectrum equation as linear system of equations (i.e., $\mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{b}$)
 - Describe the spectrum equation as an eigenvalue problem (i.e., $\mathbf{Ax}=\lambda\mathbf{x}$)
 - Plot multigroup functions (e.g., cross sections and fluxes) as functions of energy.
 - 

## Key Terms

 - linear system
 - eigensystem, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors
 

## Before Lecture

  - Supplement on the Multigroup Approximation

## After Lecture

### Homework

 - Write the two-group equations *without the multiplication factor* in terms of a
   unit source in the fast group.

 - For those same equations, find $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$.  

 - Use $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ to estimate $k_{\infty}$ as "gains over losses."

 - How do $\phi_1/\phi_2$ and $k_{\infty}$ from this fixed-source problem compare to 
   the eigenvalue problem discussed in class?
