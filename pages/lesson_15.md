# Lesson 15

<!--
09/30: provide some data beyond the textbook relative to the numbers, locations
       of various reactor types and common attributes of core configurations.
-->


## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives


Students will be able to describe the constraints on and general features of common power reactor core configurations.


### Micro Objectives

 - Explain the importance of criticality and the safe removal of heat to reactor core designs.
 - Describe the basic "unit cell" common to most power reactors.
 - Explain how the use of light water (over other moderators) impacts core size and fuel enrichment.
 

## Key Terms

 - moderator/coolant-to-fuel ratio
 - power density $P'''$
 - linear heat (generation) rate $q'$
 

## Before Lecture

  - Read 4.1 and 4.2.

## After Lecture

  None.

### Homework

  None.
