# Lesson 17

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives


Students will be able to determine the flux spectra and
multiplication factors for typical fast-spectrum reactors
based on unit-cell analysis.


### Micro Objectives

 - Define the geometry of a typical, fast-spectrum reactor unit cell.
 - Define the material composition of a typical, fast-spectrum reactor unit cell.
 - Explain the dominant features of a fast reactor's flux spectrum $\phi(E)$.

## Key Terms

 - pitch
 - cladding
 - coolant
 - volume fraction
 - unit cell (or "pin cell")
 

## Before Lecture

  - Read 4.3

## After Lecture

  The dimensions and compositions of several representative sodium-cooled, fast-reactor 
  designs are listed in [this report](https://www.oecd-nea.org/science/wprs/sfr-taskforce/WPRS-AEN-SFR-Cores-V1.2.pdf).
