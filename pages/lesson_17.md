# Lesson 17

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives


Students will be able to use the four-factor formula to 
characterize (quantitatively and qualitatively) the multiplication 
factor of a thermal-spectrum reactor based on unit-cell quantities.


### Micro Objectives

 - Define the geometry of a typical, pressurized-water reactor (PWR) unit cell.
 - Define the material composition of a typical, PWR unit cell.
 - Explain what each term of the four-factor formula describes about the 
   neutron lifecycle in a thermal-spectrum nuclear reactor.
 - Numerically evaluate each term of the four-factor formula given
   two-group, unit-cell values of cross sections and fluxes.
 - Show that the product of the two-group, two-region definitions for the four factors
   simplifies to the ratio of gains to losses.

## Key Terms

 - four-factor formula
 - resonance escape probability $p$
 - thermal utilization $f$
 - fast-fission factor $\varepsilon$
 - reproduction factor $\eta$
 - coolant
 - volume fraction
 - unit cell (or "pin cell")
