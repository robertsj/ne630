<ul>
<li><p>Read <a href="">this tutorial</a> for getting OpenMC installed on
your account. You should come to class with a 1-core, 4-GB Jupyter
session ready to go for the session. You will be submitting the in-class
activity as part of the homework.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the OpenMC <a
href="https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/usersguide/beginners.html">Beginner’s
Guide</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Read this short page about the <a
href="https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/usersguide/basics.html">basics</a>
of using OpenMC.</p></li>
<li><p>Skim this <a
href="https://nbviewer.org/github/openmc-dev/openmc-notebooks/blob/main/pincell.ipynb">Example
Notebook</a> that shows, in detail, how to model a PWR unit cell. I’ve
written a Python tool for you that automates many of the steps, but you
should be aware of what goes on in the kitchen, as it were.</p></li>
