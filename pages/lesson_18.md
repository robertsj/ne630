# Lesson 18

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives


Students will be able to run OpenMC models of typical  
SFR and PWR unit cells and to extract the results of 
these simulations for further analysis.


### Micro Objectives

 - Have an account on and be able to access [ondemand.beocat.ksu.edu](ondemand.beocat.ksu.edu).
 - Access the terminal through the browser.
 - Execute a sequence of short commands to install OpenMC and related packages.
 - Request a Jupyter instance with $N$ cores and $M$ GB of memory.
 - Use the online interface to transfer files to and from Beocat. 
 - Create and run Jupyter notebooks that use OpenMC and related packages. 

## Key Terms

 - terminal
 - OpenMC
 

## Before Lecture

  - Read [this tutorial]() for getting OpenMC installed on your account.  You should 
    come to class with a 1-core, 4-GB Jupyter session ready to go for the session.  You will 
    be submitting the in-class activity as part of the homework.

  - Read the OpenMC [Beginner's Guide](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/usersguide/beginners.html).

  - Read this short page about the [basics](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/usersguide/basics.html) of using OpenMC.

  - Skim this [Example Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/openmc-dev/openmc-notebooks/blob/main/pincell.ipynb) that shows, in detail, how to model a PWR unit cell.  I've written a Python tool 
  for you that automates many of the steps, but you should be aware of what goes on in the kitchen, 
  as it were.


## After Lecture

### Homework
