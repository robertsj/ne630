<h3 id="macro-objectives">Macro Objectives</h3>
<p>Students will be able to quantify the impact of temperature, density,
and other factors on reactivity.</p>
<h3 id="micro-objectives">Micro Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explain the relationship between reactivity and the multiplication
factor.</li>
<li>Explain why the fuel temperature coefficient (FTC) is usually
strongly negative.</li>
<li>Explain how the moderator (or coolant) temperature coefficient (MTC)
depends on geometry.</li>
<li>Explain how the fuel and coolant temperature coefficients for a
sodium-cooled fast reactor differ from those of a light-water
reactor.</li>
<li>Describe how excess reactivity is balanced by the introduction of
control (i.e., neutron “poisons”)</li>
