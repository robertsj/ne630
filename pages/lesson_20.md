# Lesson 20

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives


Students will be able to quantify the step changes in reactivity as a reactor is brought to power from 
cold, shutdown conditions. 

### Micro Objectives

 - Explain the relationship between reactivity and the multiplication factor.
 - Represent reactivity in accepted units.
 - List the integral reactivity changes observed when a reactor is brought to full power from cold, shutdown conditions.
 - Describe how excess reactivity is balanced by the introduction of control (i.e., neutron "poisons")

## Key Terms

 - reactivity
 - units of reactivity: dollars and cents; $\Delta k/k$; percent-milli (pcm)
 - power defect
 - excess reactivity
 - shutdown margin
 - cold shutdown
 - cold critical
 - hot zero power
 - hot full power
