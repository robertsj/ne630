<p>The problems below may <em>look</em> very long, but the amount of
number crunching should be reasonably small if you organize your
calculations well. I highly recommend using a Python script or a
spreadsheet so that values can be reused (or easily modified) at each
step.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>[22.1] Consider the PWR described by Problem 4.6 in the book.
We’ll walk through the basic steps that bring a reactor from cold
shutdown conditions to criticality at full power conditions. Where
needed, use cross sections listed in Table 3.2.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Compute the 4 factors for <span class="math inline">\(T_f = T_m =
300\)</span> K (i.e., room temperature). Assume that the probability of
non-leakage is <img 
class="equation_image"

alt="LaTeX: P_{NL} = 0.95"

/> and
compute the reactivity <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="\rho" 
src="/equation_images/%255Crho" 
alt="LaTeX: \rho" 
data-equation-content="\rho" 
/>. This
reactivity is the <strong>excess reactivity</strong>, <span
class="math inline">\(\rho_{\text{ex}}\)</span>, which is the core
reactivity with all removable control (e.g., control rods and <a
href="https://www.nuclear-power.com/glossary/boron-10/boric-acid-chemical-shim/">chemical
shim</a>) completely removed.</li>
<li>Suppose that the <strong>shutdown margin</strong> is -4% <span
class="math inline">\(dk/k\)</span>, i.e., when all control rods are
completely inserted, the core reactivity is -0.04. The total
<strong>reactivity worth</strong> of these control rods is <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho = \rho_{\text{ex}} - 0.04\)</span>.
What must <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_{\gamma}^{\text{con}}\)</span> be in this
<strong>cold shutdown</strong> state? You may want to re-read page
244.<br />
</li>
<li>Assume that the partial insertion of control rods can be represented
by a fraction <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="x" 
src="/equation_images/x" 
alt="LaTeX: x" 
data-equation-content="x" 
/> and that the
corresponding macroscopic cross section is <span
class="math inline">\(x\Sigma_{\gamma}^{\text{con}}\)</span>. This means
that, as a function of <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="x" 
src="/equation_images/x" 
alt="LaTeX: x" 
data-equation-content="x" 
/>, the core
reactivity should range from <span
class="math inline">\(\rho_{\text{ex}}\)</span> (for <span
class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>) down to <span
class="math inline">\(-0.04\)</span> (for <span
class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span>). Determine <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> so that our reactor is critical. We’ll
call this <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="x_{\text{cc}}"

alt="LaTeX: x_{\text{cc}}" 
data-equation-content="x_{\text{cc}}" 
/> (“cc” for
cold critical).</li>
<li>Next, the reactor coolant pumps are run until the coolant (and fuel)
reach 600 K, i.e., <strong>hot zero-power</strong> conditions. You may
assume the coolant density is 0.66 g/cm<span
class="math inline">\(^3\)</span>. Recompute <span
class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(x
= x_{\text{cc}}\)</span>).<br />
This <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="\rho" 
src="/equation_images/%255Crho" 
alt="LaTeX: \rho" 
data-equation-content="\rho" 
/> is the
<strong>temperature defect</strong>. Find <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> so that our reactor is critical; we’ll
call this <img

title="x_{hzp}" 
src="/equation_images/x_%257Bhzp%257D" 
alt="LaTeX: x_{hzp}" 
data-equation-content="x_{hzp}" 
/>.</li>
<li>Finally, the reactor is brought to <strong>full power</strong>
conditions, and the fuel temperature increases to 1200 K. Recompute
<img 
class="equation_image" 
title="\rho" 
src="/equation_images/%255Crho" 
alt="LaTeX: \rho" 
data-equation-content="\rho"

class="math inline">\(x = x_{\text{hzp}}\)</span>). This <span
class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the <strong>power
defect</strong>. Determine <span class="math inline">\(x =
x_{\text{fp}}\)</span>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>[22.2] Consider the hot, full-power conditions from part (e) of
Problem 22.1.<br />
For PWRs, excess reactivity is most often balanced by the use of boric
acid dissolved in the coolant, not by partial insertion of control rods
(which would lead to asymmetric power distributions along the length of
the fuel elements). Now, set <img
