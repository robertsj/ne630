<h3 id="macro-objectives">Macro Objectives</h3>
<p>Students will be able to quantify how fuel nuclides and core
reactivity evolve as functions of burnup.</p>
<h3 id="micro-objectives">Micro Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Define the differential equations needed to compute the
concentrations of U-235, U-238, and Pu-239 in time.</li>
<li>Write a general expression for <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> (or <span
class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>) that accounts for the transmutation
of uranium nuclides.</li>
<li>Convert between units of time and burnup.</li>
<li>Quantify what fraction of power comes from the fission of Pu-239 as
a function of time or burnup.</li>
<li>Describe how, as a function of burnup, the power changes for a fixed
flux and how the flux changes for a fixed power.</li>
<li>Explain how a reactor with a large conversion ratio can,
theoretically, produce more energy than a reactor with a small
conversion ratio.</li>
<li>Describe how burnable absorbers mixed with the fuel impact
reactivity and why that impact is sometimes required.</li>
