# Lesson 23

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives

Students will be able to quantify how fuel nuclides and core reactivity evolve as functions of burnup.

### Micro Objectives

 - Define the differential equations needed to compute the concentrations of U-235, U-238, and Pu-239 
   in time.
 - Write a general expression for $k$ (or $\rho$) that accounts for the transmutation of uranium
   nuclides.
 - Convert between units of time and burnup.
 - Quantify what fraction of power comes from the fission of Pu-239 as a function of time or burnup.
 - Describe how, as a function of burnup, the power changes for a fixed flux and how the flux changes 
   for a fixed power.
 - Explain how a reactor with a large conversion ratio can, theoretically, produce more energy than 
   a reactor with a small conversion ratio.
 - Describe how burnable absorbers mixed with the fuel impact reactivity and why that impact is sometimes required.

## Key Terms

 - actinides (specifically refers to U and to the right of U on the periodic table)
 - fission products (Xe-135, Sm-149, and several others)
 - depletion 
 - burnup
 - conversion ratio
 - breeder reactor
