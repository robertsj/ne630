<ul>
<li><p>[24.1] The reactivity <span
class="math inline">\(\rho(B)\)</span> studied in the lesson notebook
can be approximated as <span class="math inline">\(\rho(B) = 0.243 -
0.0664B\)</span>. Use this expression to estimate the cycle length and
discharge burnups for <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="N" 
src="/equation_images/N" 
alt="LaTeX: N" 
data-equation-content="N" 
/>-batch
cycles of <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="N" 
src="/equation_images/N" 
alt="LaTeX: N" 
data-equation-content="N" 
/> = 1, 2, 3, 4, and
5.<br />
Assume a 5% leakage penalty. In the limit that <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> goes to infinity, what is the discharge
burnup?</p></li>
<li><p>[24.2] For the 3-batch cycle, assume that the core reactivity is
the weighted sum of the core reactivities <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{\rho} = \frac{1}{3}\left(1.3\rho_1 +
0.9\rho_2 + 0.8\rho_3\right )\)</span>. By more heavily weighting the
more reactive (less burned) fuel, we are accounting for the increased
fission density in this fuel. How does this weighting impact the
estimated cycle length?</p></li>
