# Lesson 24

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives

Students will be able to explain cycle lengths and refueling strategies using the linear reactivity model.

### Micro Objectives

 - Provide a typical discharge burnup range for light-water reactor fuel.
 - Demonstrate that a fuel's reactivity is approximately linear with burnup
 - Estimate how much more burnup can be accumulated by fuel if it is divided into $N$ equal batches.


## Key Terms

 - cycle length ($B_c$, burnup accumulated by fuel during one cycle)
 - discharge burnup ($B_d$, total burnup accumulated by fuel before being removed for good)
 - linear reactivity model
 - $N$-batch cycle

### Homework

  - [24.1] The reactivity $\rho(B)$ studied in the lesson notebook can be approximated 
    as $\rho(B) = 0.243 - 0.0664B$. Use this expression to estimate the cycle length and 
    discharge burnups for $N$-batch cycles of $N$ = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  
    Assume a 5% leakage penalty.  In the limit that $N$ goes to infinity, what is the discharge burnup?

  - [24.2] For the 3-batch cycle, assume that the core reactivity is the weighted sum of the core 
    reactivities $\bar{\rho} = \frac{1}{3}\left(1.3\rho_1 + 0.9\rho_2 + 0.8\rho_3\right )$.
    By more heavily weighting the more reactive (less burned) fuel, we are accounting for the increased fission density in this fuel.  How does this weighting impact the estimated cycle length?
