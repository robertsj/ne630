<h3 id="macro-objectives">Macro Objectives</h3>
<p>Students will be able to write down, to solve, and to explain each
term of a first-order, ordinary differential equation that models the
neutron flux, the neutron density, or the number of neutrons in a
non-multiplying system as a function of time.</p>
<h3 id="micro-objectives">Micro Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explain how the neutron kinetics equation is derived.</li>
<li>Write an expression for the effective speed of neutrons in a given
energy group.</li>
<li>Identify the similarities between the neutron lifetime and the
neutron mean-free path.</li>
<li>Predict the neutron density as a function of time in an infinite,
non-multiplying system.</li>
<li>Estimate the lifetime of a thermal neutron from appropriate nuclear
data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-terms">Key Terms</h2>
<ul>
<li>reactor kinetics (to be contrasted with <em>reactor
dynamics</em>)</li>
<li>mean neutron speed</li>
<li>mean neutron lifetime</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="before-lecture">Before Lecture</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read 5.1-5.2 (emphasis through Eq. (5.8))</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<ul>
<li>[25.1] Problem 5.1 from the text.</li>
<li>[25.2] In class, we defined <span class="math inline">\(\bar{v} =
\frac{\int^{\infty}_0 \phi(E)
dE}  {\int^{\infty}_0\frac{\phi(E)dE}{v(E)}}\)</span>. Is this
consistent with Eq. (3.44) in the text? Explain.</li>
</ul>
