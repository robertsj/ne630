# Lesson 25

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives

Students will be able to write down, to solve, and to explain each term of a first-order, ordinary differential 
equation that models the neutron flux, the neutron density, or the number of 
neutrons in a non-multiplying system as a function of time.

### Micro Objectives

 - Explain how the neutron kinetics equation is derived.
 - Write an expression for the effective speed of neutrons in a given energy group.
 - Identify the similarities between the neutron lifetime and the neutron mean-free path.
 - Predict the neutron density as a function of time in an infinite, non-multiplying
   system.
 - Estimate the lifetime of a thermal neutron from appropriate nuclear data.

## Key Terms

 - reactor kinetics (to be contrasted with *reactor dynamics*)
 - mean neutron speed
 - mean neutron lifetime

## Before Lecture

  - Read 5.1-5.2 (emphasis through Eq. (5.8))

## After Lecture

### Homework

  - [25.1] Problem 5.1 from the text.
  - [25.2] In class, we defined $\bar{v} = \frac{\int^{\infty}_0 \phi(E) dE}
                {\int^{\infty}_0\frac{\phi(E)dE}{v(E)}}$.  Is this consistent
           with Eq. (3.44) in the text?  Explain.
