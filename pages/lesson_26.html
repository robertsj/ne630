<p>Students will be able to write down, to solve, and to explain each
term of a first-order, ordinary differential equation that models the
neutron flux, the neutron density, or the number of neutrons a
multiplying system in the absence of delayed neutron precursors.</p>
<h3 id="micro-objectives">Micro Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explain how changes in the neutron population with time depend on
the systemâ€™s multiplication factor (or reactivity).</li>

system.</li>
