# Lesson 26

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives

Students will be able to write down, to solve, and to explain each term of a first-order, ordinary differential 
equation that models the neutron flux, the neutron density, or the number of 
neutrons a multiplying system in the absence of delayed neutron precursors.

### Micro Objectives

 - Explain how changes in the neutron population with time depend on the system's 
   multiplication factor (or reactivity).
 - Show by how much a source of neutrons is amplified in a subcritical system.

## Key Terms

 - mean (or prompt) generation time $\Lambda$
 - reactor period $T$

## Before Lecture

  - Read 5.2-5.3

## After Lecture
