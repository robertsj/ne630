<h3 id="macro-objectives">Macro Objectives</h3>
<p>Students will be able to write down, to explain each term of a system
of, and to solve numerically the system of first-order, ordinary
differential equations that model the neutron density and the densities
of delayed neutron precursors in time.</p>
<h3 id="micro-objectives">Micro Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explain how neutrons can be produced relatively long after a fission
has occured.</li>
<li>Show how a delayed neutron precursor concentration <span
class="math inline">\(C_i(t)\)</span> is related to the physical
concentration of a fission product and its daughters.</li>
<li>Provide representative values for the delayed neutron fraction of
different fissile nuclides.</li>
<li>Show that, in the one-group approximation, the inclusion of
delayed-neutron precursors does not impact a steady-state system.</li>
<li>Quantify how delayed neutrons impact the neutron lifetime.</li>
<li>Use <code>odeint</code> or similar tools to solve numerically
systems of first-order differential equations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-terms">Key Terms</h2>

<li>precursor group (indexed by the <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in <span

</ul>
<h2 id="before-lecture">Before Lecture</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read Section 5.4.</li>
<li>Read <a
href="https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/lectures/Systems_Of_IVPs.html#SciPy&#39;s-odeint">these
notes</a> on use of <code>odeint</code> for solving systems of
initial-value problems.</li>

<li>[27.1] Problem 5.2 from the text.</li>
<li>[27.2] Like Problem 5.16 from the text, but set <span

class="math inline">\(0 \leq t &lt; 1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\rho(t) \pm 0.25\beta\)</span> (i.e., 0.25
dollars) for <img

data-equation-content="\rho(t) = 0" 
/> at the beginning, we
can verify that the system remains in steady state. Remember, you need
to find the appropriate precursor concentrations for steady state to use
for initial conditions. You may assume that <span
