# Lesson 28

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives

Students will be able to solve the kinetics equations subject to step insertions of reactivity and to predict neutron and precursor densities and reactor periods from those solutions and approximations thereof. 

### Micro Objectives

 - Explain how and why the solution to the kinetics equations fundamentally changes when $\rho$ exceeds $\beta$.
 - Approximate the neutron density immediately following a step insertion of reactivity. 
 - Explain why the reactor power can never be reduced to zero immediately.
 - Explain how an image like Figure 5.3 in the text can be used to predict $T$ given $\rho$
   and vice versa for a given reactor.
 - Explain how an image like Figure 5.4 in the text can be used to predict $T$ given $\rho$
   and vice versa for various reactors.
 - Solve by hand the kinetics equations with a single precursor group.

## Key Terms


 - prompt (super)critical
 - delayed (super)critical
 - step reactivity change
 - the "inhour" equation (strangely, I've *never* seen $\omega$ with units of inverse hours!)
 - prompt jump approximation
 -
