<h3 id="macro-objectives">Macro Objectives</h3>
<p>Students will be able to show that neutrons are conserved (or not) in
a spatial volume given the neutron flux and appropriate cross-section
data.</p>
<h3 id="micro-objectives">Micro Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write down, in plain English, a statement that describes neutron
balance in a control volume.</li>
<li>Explain what the neutron current <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{J}\)</span> represents. Note that a vector
<img 
class="equation_image" 
title="\vec{x}" 
src="/equation_images/%255Cvec%257Bx%257D" 
alt="LaTeX: \vec{x}" 
data-equation-content="\vec{x}" 
/> can also be written <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Given a neutron flux <span
class="math inline">\(\phi(\vec{r})\)</span> and a diffusion coefficient
<img 
class="equation_image" 
title="D(\mathbf{r})" 
src="/equation_images/D(%255Cmathbf%257Br%257D)" 
alt="LaTeX: D(\mathbf{r})" 
data-equation-content="D(\mathbf{r})" 
/>, compute the neutron
current.</li>
<li>Integrate the neutron continuity equation (Lewis, Eq. (6.10)) or the
neutron diffusion equation (Lewis, Eq. (6.12)) over a control
volume.</li>
<li>Describe how the neutron diffusion equation is similar to and
different from other conservation equations in engineering.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-terms">Key Terms</h2>
<ul>
<li>leakage</li>
<li>diffusion coefficient</li>
<li>Fick’s law</li>
<li>gradient (of a function), <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\nabla}
f\)</span></li>
<li>divergence (of a vector), <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\nabla}
\cdot \vec{v}\)</span></li>
<li>Laplacian (of a function), <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\nabla}
f = \vec{\Delta} f\)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="before-lecture">Before Lecture</h2>
<p>You are responsible for doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read Sections 6.1 and 6.2, and <strong>take notes</strong>,
<strong>upload your notes</strong> by 1 pm (before lecture), and
<strong>bring these to class</strong>. On the Lesson 7 page, I provided
<a
href="https://k-state.instructure.com/courses/144758/files/33983345/download?download_frd=1">this
example</a> of notes I took while reading Sections 3.1–3.3. In your
notes, include questions you have as you read related to vocabulary and
symbols, and then make an effort to answer your questions. As an
example, if you get to Eq. (6.10) and don’t recognize <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{\nabla}\)</span>, then you need to review
your MATH 222 materials and add the appropriate definitions, examples,
etc., to your notes. This is the standard of preparation I expect for
the rest of the semester.</li>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<ul>
<li>[30.0] Notes (4 points for proper submissions during a given
week).</li>
<li>[30.1] Consider a cubic, homogeneous system defined for <span
class="math inline">\(x \in [-1, 1]\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y \in [-1, 1]\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z \in [-1, 1]\)</span> characterized by a
diffusion coefficient <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="D" 
src="/equation_images/D" 
alt="LaTeX: D" 
data-equation-content="D" 
/> and
absorption cross section <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="\Sigma_a" 
src="/equation_images/%255CSigma_a" 
alt="LaTeX: \Sigma_a" 
data-equation-content="\Sigma_a" 
/>.
For some (unknown) neutron source distribution <span
class="math inline">\(s(\vec{r})\)</span>, suppose the steady-state
neutron flux is <span class="math inline">\(\phi(\vec{r}) = \phi(x, y,
z) = (1-x^2)(1-y^2)\)</span>. Compute the (1) total absorption rate in
the system and (2) the leakage through each of its 6 faces. Assuming
that the medium is nonmultiplying, evaluate <span
class="math inline">\(\int^1_{-1}\int^1_{-1}\int^1_{-1}
s(x,y,z)dxdydz\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
