<p>Students will be able to show that neutrons are conserved (or not) in
a spatial volume given the neutron flux and appropriate cross-section
data.</p>
<h3 id="micro-objectives">Micro Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write down, in plain English, a statement that describes neutron
balance in a control volume.</li>
<li>Explain what the neutron current <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{J}\)</span> represents. Note that a vector
<img

title="\vec{x}" 
src="/equation_images/%255Cvec%257Bx%257D" 
alt="LaTeX: \vec{x}" 
data-equation-content="\vec{x}" 
/> can also be written <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Given a neutron flux <span
class="math inline">\(\phi(\vec{r})\)</span> and a diffusion coefficient
<img 
class="equation_image" 
title="D(\mathbf{r})" 
src="/equation_images/D(%255Cmathbf%257Br%257D)" 
alt="LaTeX: D(\mathbf{r})" 
data-equation-content="D(\mathbf{r})" 
/>, compute the neutron
current.</li>
<li>Integrate the neutron continuity equation (Lewis, Eq. (6.10)) or the
neutron diffusion equation (Lewis, Eq. (6.12)) over a control
volume.</li>
<li>Describe how the neutron diffusion equation is similar to and
different from other conservation equations in engineering.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-terms">Key Terms</h2>
<ul>
<li>leakage</li>
<li>diffusion coefficient</li>
<li>Fick’s law</li>
<li>gradient (of a function), <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\nabla}
f\)</span></li>
<li>divergence (of a vector), <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\nabla}
\cdot \vec{v}\)</span></li>
<li>Laplacian (of a function), <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{\nabla}^2 f = \vec{\Delta} f\)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="before-lecture">Before Lecture</h2>
<p>You are responsible for doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read Sections 6.1 and 6.2, and <strong>take notes</strong>,
<strong>upload your notes</strong> by 1 pm (before lecture), and
<strong>bring these to class</strong>. On the Lesson 7 page, I provided
<a
href="https://k-state.instructure.com/courses/144758/files/33983345/download?download_frd=1">this
example</a> of notes I took while reading Sections 3.1–3.3. In your
notes, include definitions for the Key Terms above and questions you
have as you read related to vocabulary and symbols. Then, make an effort
to answer your questions! As an example, if you get to Eq. (6.10) and
don’t recognize <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="\vec{\nabla}" 
src="/equation_images/%255Cvec%257B%255Cnabla%257D" 
alt="LaTeX: \vec{\nabla}" 
data-equation-content="\vec{\nabla}" 
/>, then
you need to review your MATH 222 materials and add the appropriate
definitions, examples, etc., to your notes. This is the standard of
preparation I expect for the rest of the semester.</li>

Suppose the steady-state neutron flux is <span
class="math inline">\(\phi(\vec{r}) = \phi(x, y, z) =
(1-x^2)(1-y^2)\)</span>. What is the source distribution <span
class="math inline">\(s(\vec{r})\)</span> [1/cm<span
class="math inline">\(^3\)</span>-s]?</li>
<li>[31.2] For the same system, compute the (1) total absorption rate
[1/s] in the system and (2) the leakage rates [1/s] through each of its
6 faces. Show that the sum of the absorption rate and leakage rates
equals the volume integral of your source distribution from [30.1].</li>
