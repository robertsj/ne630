<ul>
<li>Explain what is meant by “slab” geometry and under which conditions
such a model is of use.</li>
<li>Describe what “homogeneous” and “particular” solutions are and the
basic techniques used to find them.</li>
<li>Verify that a solution <img

<p>You are responsible for doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read Section 6.3.</li>
<li>Although we’ll review some aspects of solving second-order ODEs over
the next several lessons, you should be generally familiar with solving
such equations, especially when the equation has “constant
coefficients.” Here’s <a
href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/IntroSecondOrder.aspx">one
resource</a> that may help you refresh what you once learned.</li>
