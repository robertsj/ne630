<p>Students will be able to define and solve the equations representing
multi-region, source-driven, slab systems subject to vacuum and
reflecting boundary conditions.</p>
<h3 id="micro-objectives">Micro Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explain in plain English what is meant by “partial current.”</li>
<li>List the quantities involved in the diffusion equation that must be
continuous throughout the domain.</li>
<li>For a homogeneous region within a slab system of one or more
regions, determine the particular solution given the source term <span
class="math inline">\(s(x)\)</span> in that region.</li>
<li>Given the homogeneous and particular solutions for each of <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> regions of a heterogeneous slab and the
boundary conditions at the left and ride surfaces of the slab, write
down the system of <img

MATH 551) to solve linear systems.</li>

<h2 id="before-lecture">Before Lecture</h2>
<p>You are responsible for doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read Section 6.4.</li>
<li>Review how to solve linear systems. As I’ve mentioned, I’m usually
against doing pages of algebra just to find expressions for the
constants of integration when solving ODEs (unless the resulting
expressions are of some unique value—and that’s rare in my experience).
Thus, I strongly recommend the use of numerical tools when appropriate,
and for solving matrix systems, I recommend <a
href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.solve.html">NumPy</a>.</li>
