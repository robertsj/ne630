<p>Students will be able to define and solve the equations representing
multi-region, source-driven, slab systems with multiplication subject to
vacuum and reflecting boundary conditions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Explain how the inclusion of multiplication can fundamentally change
the solution of the diffusion equation.</li>
<li>Explain how an increasing <span

<p>You are responsible for doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read Sections 6.5 and 6.7. Our main focus is on source-driven
systems with multiplication, covered by Section 6.7, but it will help to
have a familiarity with the diffusion equation in spherical coordinates,
which is covered in Section 6.5. In your notes, pay specific attention
to the steps leading to Eqs. (6.95), (6.103), and (6.106) and try to
develop analogous expressions for a slab of width <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> centered at the origin with <span
class="math inline">\(\phi(\tilde{a}/2) = \phi(-\tilde{a}/2) =
0\)</span>.</li>

slab of width <img

at the left boundary, while the right boundary is adjacent to vacuum.
Assume that the slab is fissile, i.e., <span
