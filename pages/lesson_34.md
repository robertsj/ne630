# Lesson 34

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives

Students will be able to define and solve the equations representing multi-region, source-driven, slab systems with multiplication subject to vacuum and reflecting boundary conditions. 

### Micro Objectives

 - Explain how the inclusion of multiplication can fundamentally change the solution of the diffusion equation.
 - Explain how an increasing $k_{\infty}$ impacts the flux magnitude in a subcritical system.  

## Key Terms

 - buckling
  

## Before Lecture

You are responsible for doing the following:

  - Read Sections 6.5 and 6.7.  Our main focus is on source-driven systems with multiplication, covered by Section 6.7, but it will help to have a familiarity with the diffusion equation in spherical coordinates, which is covered in Section 6.5.  In your notes, pay specific attention to the steps leading to Eqs. (6.95), (6.103), and (6.106) and try to develop analogous expressions for a slab of width $a$ centered at the origin with $\phi(\tilde{a}/2) = \phi(-\tilde{a}/2) = 0$.
  

## After Lecture

### Homework


- [34.1] This problem extends [33.2].  Consider again a source-free slab of width $a$.
    An incident partial current of $J^L_{in}$ enters at the left 
    boundary, while the right boundary is adjacent to vacuum.
    Assume that the slab is fissile, i.e., $\nu\Sigma_f > 0$ or $k_{\infty} > 0$.
    
    a. Determine the transmission coefficient $T = J^R_{out}/J^L_{in}$.  Make sure
       to handle the cases $k_{\infty} < 1$ and $k_{\infty} > 1$ separately.

    b. For $a = 50$ cm, $D = 1.0$ cm, and $\Sigma_a = 0.02$ 1/cm,
    plot $T$ as a function of $k_{\infty}$ for $0 \leq k_{\infty} < 1.16$.
