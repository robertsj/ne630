<ul>
<li>[35.1] Assume that <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="a=50" 
src="/equation_images/a%253D50" 
alt="LaTeX: a=50" 
data-equation-content="a=50" 
/> [cm]
and <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="D=1" 
src="/equation_images/D%253D1" 
alt="LaTeX: D=1" 
data-equation-content="D=1" 
/> cm. Determine the critical
buckling <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="B^2" 
src="/equation_images/B%255E2" 
alt="LaTeX: B^2" 
data-equation-content="B^2" 
/> to at least 4 decimal
places using the criticality condition defined above. You may find it
useful to plot both sides of the equation against the independent
variable <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="B" 
src="/equation_images/B" 
alt="LaTeX: B" 
data-equation-content="B" 
/> to help find where they
intersect.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hint</em>: we already know that the zero-flux condition
artificially forces the flux to zero at the boundary and causes the
gradient (and, hence, leakage) to be larger. Because the buckling is
proportional to this leakage, you should expect <span
class="math inline">\(B^2\)</span> to be less than <span
class="math inline">\(\pi^2/a^2\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>[35.2] Consider an infinitely tall cylindrical reactor of radius
<img 
class="equation_image" 
title="R" 
src="/equation_images/R" 
alt="LaTeX: R" 
data-equation-content="R" 
/> subject to a vacuum boundary
condition. By following the example given for the slab reactor, derive a
similar <em>criticality condition</em> for the critical buckling. Then,
for <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="R = 25" 
src="/equation_images/R%2520%253D%252025" 
alt="LaTeX: R = 25" 
data-equation-content="R = 25" 
/> cm, <span
class="math inline">\(D=1\)</span> cm, <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_a = 0.1\)</span> 1/cm, and <span
class="math inline">\(k_{\infty} = 1.5\)</span>, determine the critical
buckling <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="B^2" 
src="/equation_images/B%255E2" 
alt="LaTeX: B^2" 
data-equation-content="B^2" 
/> and the corresponding
multiplication factor <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="k" 
src="/equation_images/k" 
alt="LaTeX: k" 
data-equation-content="k" 
/>.</li>
</ul>
