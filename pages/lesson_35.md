### Homework


- [35.1] Assume that $a=50$ [cm] and $D=1$ cm.  Determine the critical buckling $B^2$ to at least 4 decimal places using the criticality condition defined above.  You may find it useful to plot both sides of the equation against the independent variable $B$ to help find where they intersect.  

*Hint*: we already know that the zero-flux condition artificially forces the flux to zero at the boundary and causes the gradient (and, hence, leakage) to be larger.  Because the buckling is proportional to this leakage, you should expect $B^2$ to be less than $\pi^2/a^2$.

- [35.2] Consider an infinitely tall cylindrical reactor of radius $R$ subject to a vacuum boundary condition.  By following the example given for the slab reactor, derive a similar *criticality condition* for the critical buckling.  Then, for $R = 25$ cm,  $D=1$ cm, $\Sigma_a = 0.1$ 1/cm, and $k_{\infty} = 1.5$, determine the critical buckling $B^2$ and the corresponding multiplication factor $k$.
