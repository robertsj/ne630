<h3 id="macro-objectives">Macro Objectives</h3>
<p>Students will be able to write down the equations necessary to model
multi-region reactors using the two-group approximation and to solve
such equations numerically.</p>
<h3 id="micro-objectives">Micro Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explain what the <em>removal cross section</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_r\)</span> represents.</li>
<li>Explain what the scattering cross section <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_{s_{2\gets 1}}\)</span> represents. (Pay
attention to the arrow, which I use to make explicit how the indices are
ordered!)</li>
<li>Explain why the “right-hand sides” of the two-group equations (in
Eq. (7-40) of Duderstadt and Hamilton; see reading below) are the
appropriate “gains” terms for each energy group.</li>
<li>Explain what the migration area is as it relates to a neutron’s
life.</li>
<li>Determine <img

title="k" 
src="/equation_images/k" 
alt="LaTeX: k" 
data-equation-content="k" 
/> for a bare,
homogeneous reactor in 1-D slab or 1-D cylindrical coordinates subject
to zero-flux boundary conditions.</li>
<li>Describe why one would use <img

title="M^2" 
src="/equation_images/M%255E2" 
alt="LaTeX: M^2" 
data-equation-content="M^2"

in place of <img

title="L_1^2" 
src="/equation_images/L_1%255E2" 
alt="LaTeX: L_1^2" 
data-equation-content="L_1^2" 
/> in the modified
one-group diffusion.</li>

<ul>
<li>two-group approximation</li>

<li>removal cross section</li>
<li>migration length</li>

<li>six-factor formula</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="before-lecture">Before Lecture</h2>
<p>You are responsible for doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read <a href="link">Section 7.III.B-7.III.C</a> of Duderstadt and
Hamiliton (D&amp;H). I’ve annotated the linked PDF with a few comments.
I’ve also highlighted a number of terms and equations that you should
make sure to define in your notes.</li>
<li>Read Section 7.4 of Lewis. Although the D&amp;H sections provide the
fundamental “equations,” Lewis provides some physical “insight”
regarding the numerical values of the two-group diffusion lengths and
associated migration area.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<ul>
<li>[36.1] Consider a bare, homogeneous slab reactor of width <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Use the two-group data of Table 7-2 in
D&amp;H to determine the critical width <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> assuming that <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_g(-a/2) = \phi_g{a/2} = 0\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(g = 1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g=2\)</span>. How would your answer differ if we
applied vacuum conditions instead? Explain.</li>
</ul>
