<ul>
<li><p>[37.1] Consider a homogeneous slab reactor of width <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> surrounded by a reflector of thickness
<img 
class="equation_image" 
title="t" 
src="/equation_images/t" 
alt="LaTeX: t" 
data-equation-content="t" 
/> subject to <span
class="math inline">\(\phi(a/2+t)= \phi(-a/2-t) = 0\)</span> (i.e., the
flux goes to zero at the far edge of either reflector). Because of
symmetry, we can define the core (fueled) region to be <span
class="math inline">\(0 \leq x \leq a/2\)</span> with reflection at
<img 
class="equation_image" 
title="x=0" 
src="/equation_images/x%253D0" 
alt="LaTeX: x=0" 
data-equation-content="x=0" 
/> (with <span
class="math inline">\(\phi(a/2+t) = 0\)</span> at the right). Write down
the full set of equations needed to determine any undetermined constants
of integration and the eigenvalue <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>[37.2] Assume that the modified one-group diffusion equation
(with <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="M^2" 
src="/equation_images/M%255E2" 
alt="LaTeX: M^2" 
data-equation-content="M^2" 
/>) is applicable to the
model defined in [37.1].</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Part (a). Use the two-group data from Table 7-2 of D&amp;H for
the fuel region and the two-group data of Problem 7-18 of D&amp;H for
the reflector (water) region. Then, assuming that the reflector
thickness is <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="t = 20" 
src="/equation_images/t%2520%253D%252020" 
alt="LaTeX: t = 20" 
data-equation-content="t = 20" 
/> cm, determine
the critical width <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="a" 
src="/equation_images/a" 
alt="LaTeX: a" 
data-equation-content="a" 
/>.</p></li>
<li><p>Part (b). Use your answers from (b) and [36.1] to compute the
reflector savings.</p></li>
<li><p>Part (c). Plot <img 
class="equation_image" 
title="\phi(x)"

alt="LaTeX: \phi(x)" 
data-equation-content="\phi(x)"

class="math inline">\(\phi(0) = 1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Part (d). Were you to solve the full set of equations defined in
[37.1], you would have both the thermal and fast fluxes. Rather than
compute them explicitly, sketch the two-group fluxes on top of your
graph from Part (c).</p></li>
