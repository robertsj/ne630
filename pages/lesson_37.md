# Lesson 37

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives

Students will be able to characterize both quantitatively and qualitatively the impact of a reflector region on an otherwise bare reactor core using diffusion theory.

### Micro Objectives

 - Explain why reflectors are used in reactor systems.
 - Estimate by how much a reflector reduces leakage losses from a reactor core.
 - Describe the properties needed by a good neutron reflector.
 - Compute the reflector savings for a slab reactor using one-group diffusion theory.
 - Sketch the flux profile through a core and reflector region in both the one- and
   two-group approximations.

## Key Terms

 - reflector savings
 - flux/power flattening

### Homework


- [37.1] Consider a homogeneous slab reactor of width $a$ surrounded by a reflector of thickness $t$ subject to $\phi(a/2+t)= \phi(-a/2-t) = 0$ (i.e., the flux goes to zero at the far edge of either reflector).  Because of symmetry, we can define the core (fueled) region to be $0 \leq x \leq a/2$ with reflection at $x=0$ (with $\phi(a/2+t) = 0$ at the right).  Write down the full set of equations needed to determine any undetermined constants of integration and the eigenvalue $k$.  

- [37.2] Assume that the modified one-group diffusion equation (with $M^2$) is 
applicable to the model defined in [37.1].

  - Part (a).  Use the two-group data from Table 7-2 of D&H for the fuel region and the two-group data of Problem 7-18 of D&H for the reflector (water) region.  Then, assuming that the reflector thickness is $t = 20$ cm, determine the critical width $a$.

  - Part (b).  Use your answers from (b) and [36.1] to compute the reflector savings.

  - Part (c).  Plot $\phi(x)$ for $0 \leq x \leq a + t$.  Normalize $\phi(x)$ so that $\phi(0) = 1$.  

  - Part (d).  Were you to solve the full set of equations defined in [37.1], you would have both the thermal and fast fluxes.  Rather than compute them explicitly, sketch the two-group fluxes on top of your graph from Part (c).
