<ul>
<li>[38.1] Consider the infinite cylindrical reactor defined in Problem
[35.2]. Suppose that we model the complete insertion of a control
element by increasing the the absorption cross secton from <span
class="math inline">\(0.1\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(0.2\)</span> 1/cm from <span
class="math inline">\(r = 0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(r =
5\)</span> cm. Determine the reactivity worth of this element using
first-order perturbation theory. (Hint: <span
class="math inline">\(\int^{r}_0 r&#39; J_0(r&#39;) dr&#39; =
rJ_1(r)\)</span>, but don’t forget to handle the <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(J_0(Br)\)</span> when dealing with derivatives and
integrals.)</li>
</ul>
