# Lesson 38

## Learning Objectives

### Macro Objectives

Students will be able to use the one-group diffusion approximation to estimate how a small and localized perturbation in a reactor core changes the reactivity of the system.

### Micro Objectives

 - Explain how the first-order perturbation estimate for $\Delta \rho$ is obtained using one-group diffusion theory.

 - Explain why perturbation theory is accurate only for "small" changes in system properties (e.g., an absorption cross section).


## Key Terms

 - reactivity worth
 - control element
 - first-order perturbation theory

### Homework


- [38.1] Consider the infinite cylindrical reactor defined in Problem [35.2].  Suppose that we model the complete insertion of a control element by increasing the the absorption cross secton from $0.1$ to $0.2$ 1/cm from $r = 0$ to $r = 5$ cm.  Determine the reactivity worth of this element 
using first-order perturbation theory.
(Hint: $\int^{r}_0 r' J_0(r') dr' = rJ_1(r)$, but don't forget to handle the $B$ in $J_0(Br)$ when dealing 
with derivatives and integrals.)
