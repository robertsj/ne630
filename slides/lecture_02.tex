\begin{frame}{Primary Objective}

Students will be able to 

\vfill


\begin{quote}
\textcolor{wcprimary}{characterize the neutron population and energy produced
as a function of time in terms of the neutron lifetime, 
the energy released per fission, and 
the multiplication factor.}

\begin{frame}{Review: Binding Energy}

Recall that the {\bf mass defect} of a nuclide ${}^A_Z$X$_N$ is defined as 

\begin{equation*}
 \Delta = Z M_P + \overbrace{(A-Z)}^{N} M_N - M_X \, ,
 \tag{FNRP 1.18}
\end{equation*}

where $M_X$, $M_P$, and $M_N$ are the masses of the nuclide, 
proton (as ${}^1$H), and neutron.

\pause
\vfill 

The {\bf binding energy} per nucleon is then given by 

\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\text{BE}}{A} = \frac{\Delta c^2}{N+Z} \, .
  \tag{FNRP 1.19}
\end{equation*}

Can you explain which competing effects drive the shape of this curve?

\vfill

Which processes tend to bring less stable low- and high-mass 
nuclides toward the center?

\begin{frame}{Fusion}

Fusion reactions {\it combine} two light nuclei, e.g., 

\begin{align*}
 \tag{D-T}
 {}^2_1 \text{H} +  {}^3_1 \text{H} &\longrightarrow  {}^4_2 \text{He} +  {}^1_0 \text{n} + 17.59~\text{MeV} \\
 \tag{D-D}
 {}^2_1 \text{H} +  {}^2_1 \text{H} &\longrightarrow  {}^3_1 \text{H} +  {}^1_1 \text{H} + 4.02~\text{MeV}
\end{align*}

\pause 
\vfill 

...but to get two positive charges close enough to fuse remains a monumental engineering challenge!

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Fission}

Fission reactions {\it split} a heavy nucleus into (usually) two pieces 
characterized by

\begin{enumerate}
 \item large kinetic energies 
 \item excitation energies and ``evaporation'' of $\gamma$'s and n's
\end{enumerate}

These prompt emissions emerge  within
$\approx10^{-17}$ s of the split 
and within $\approx10^{-7}$ s of the initiating event (i.e., a neutron absorption). 

\pause 
\vfill 

How much energy is released in a typical fission reaction?

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Example}

Consider the symmetric fission 

\begin{equation*}
 {}^1_0 \text{n} +  {}^{235}_{92} \text{U} \quad \longrightarrow \quad {}^{117}_{46} \text{Pd} +  {}^{117}_{46} \text{Pd} + 2 \, {}^1_0 \text{n} 
\end{equation*}

for which the masses are  $M({}^{235}_{92} \text{U}) = 235.043928$ u, $M({}^{117}_{46} \text{Pd}) = 116.917956$ u, and 
 $M_N = 1.0086649$ u.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Compute the $Q$ value of this reaction (we'll call this $Q_{\text{prompt}}$)
 \item Consider the subsequent $\beta^{-}$ decays of the neutron rich fragments: 
 ${}^{117}_{46}\text{Pd} \to {}^{117}\text{Al} \to {}^{117}\text{Cd} \to {}^{117}\text{In} \to {}^{117}_{50}\text{Sn}$.
 If  $M({}^{117}_{50} \text{Sn}) = 116.902955$ u, what's the ``total'' $Q$ value?
\end{enumerate}

\vfill
\pause 

{\tiny
{\it Answers}: \\
$Q_{\text{prompt}} = \Big[M({}^{235}_{92})-2\cdot M({}^{117}_{46} \text{Pd})-M_N) \Big]c^2 \approx 185.7$ MeV\\
$Q_{\text{total}} = \Big[M({}^{235}_{92})-2\cdot M({}^{117}_{50} \text{Sn})-M_N) \Big]c^2 \approx   213.6$ MeV. \\
The extra energy goes to delayed n's ($\approx 7$ MeV), $\gamma$'s ($\approx 7$ MeV), and $\bar{\nu}$'s ($\approx 10$ MeV), the latter of which is {\it not} recoverable for power generation.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Decay Heat}

Because the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ energy is released as the n-rich fragments and their daughters decay, nuclear fuel 
produces substantial heat for some time after shutdown.  



\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Multiplication and Chain Reactions}

We know ``2--3'' neutrons are released per fission.  If those neutrons can cause additional fissions, we get a chain reaction.

\vfill

Let 
\begin{equation*}
 k = \frac{\text{\# n's in generation i}}{\text{\# n's in generation i - 1}}
\end{equation*}

Then
\begin{equation*}
 n(t) = n_0 k^{t/l}
\end{equation*}
or, for $k \approx 1$, 
\begin{equation*}
 n(t) = n(0) \exp{ \left ( \frac{k-1}{l} \right ) } \, .
\end{equation*}
